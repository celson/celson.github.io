As a Messaging Platform Engineer at Stone Co., I am responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the messaging infrastructure that supports real-time communication across our systems. This includes architecting scalable and resilient messaging solutions, integrating with diverse communication protocols (such as MQTT, AMQP, or WebSocket), and ensuring seamless interoperability between different applications and services.

I collaborate closely with software developers, system architects, and DevOps teams to implement messaging patterns that optimize performance, reliability, and security. This involves creating robust APIs for message queuing, handling asynchronous communication flows, and implementing message routing and delivery mechanisms that guarantee high availability and fault tolerance.

Additionally, my role entails monitoring the health and performance of our messaging systems using monitoring tools and implementing proactive measures to prevent bottlenecks or failures. I am also responsible for troubleshooting issues related to message delivery, ensuring data integrity, and implementing encryption and authentication mechanisms to safeguard sensitive information.

In summary, I contribute to the foundational infrastructure that enables efficient and secure messaging capabilities, supporting the seamless flow of information critical to the operations of Stone Co. and enhancing the overall user experience.
